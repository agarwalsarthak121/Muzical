## How it Works ?

To get started, first create a new album. When adding an album cover logo, it's best to have a resolution of at least 512x512 and to use common image formats such as JPG, JPEG, or PNG.
After an album is created you will then be able to add/upload songs. Currently supported file types are WAV, MP3, and OGG.Once songs are added to an album you are then able to play, favorite, and delete them.
You can also create your profile.
